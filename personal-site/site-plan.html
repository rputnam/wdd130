        Hey there! I’m Randi Putnam. An aspiring artist and entrepreneur. My passion is all things design and art! I have always loved art since I was old enough to hold a pencil but I did not want to be a “starving artist” so I pursued a degree in Educational Psychology instead. Fast forward years later and I have rediscovered my passion for drawing and watercolor.  Here is my journey as I learn watercolor, colored pencil and pastel. Join me as I document the art I create using tutorials and as I create my own original pieces.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I am drawn to nature and botanical art. I have always been fascinated by the trees and the flowers surrounding me. There is so much beauty around us and I believe it is a gift from our Heavenly Father. God created this world for us to enjoy and I am passionate about trying to recreate what I see around me. 
      </p>

        “By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him…And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” (Col. 1:16-17.)

      <h3>Holiday Art</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the art pieces I have created and shared are of realistic botanical watercolor paintings. I first began to experiment with colored pencils and pastels when I was a child. So I decided to give it a try again and created an original piece using only colored pencils. The American Flag is an important symbol of freedom and I have titled it “In God We Trust”. I have also begun to branch out and have painted other pieces that like this pumpkin. With this pumpkin I used watercolor paints.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Meet the Artist! 
      </p>
        I love nature! I always have since I can remember. Being in nature helps me feel connected to God. I love being outside and seeing the beauty of the trees and the flowers. I am always amazed and mesmerized by the detail and the colors I see! When I stop and look at God's creations around me, I feel a strong sense of reverence and awe for the beauty that surrounds me. The beauty of the earth is a gift and a retreat from the loud and confusing world. The sense of peace and comfort that washes over me when I am in nature helps me to feel grounded, renewed and a deep spiritual connection to my Heavenly Father.
      </p>
        The warm sun on my face, the smell of fresh fallen rain, the chill crisp fall air and crunch of the beautiful autumn leaves, the smell of roses or pine needles, all confirms to me that God lives. If the amount of intricate detail put into these creations were important to Him, how much more did he put into us? The beautiful creations surrounding us helps me remember that we are also His creations and we are His. President M. Russel Ballard taught, “To truly reverence the Creator, we must appreciate his creations. We need to plan to take time to observe the marvels of nature. … Take time to sit on a hillside and feel the tranquility of the evening when the sun casts its last golden glow over the horizon.”
