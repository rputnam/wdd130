            <p>Hey there! I’m Randi Putnam. An aspiring artist and entrepreneur. My passion is all things design and art! I have always loved art since I was old enough to hold a pencil but I did not want to be a “starving artist” so I pursued a degree in Educational Psychology instead. Fast forward years later and I have rediscovered my passion for drawing and watercolor. Here is my journey as I learn watercolor, colored pencil and pastel. Join me as I document the art I create using tutorials and as I create my own original pieces.</p>

                <p>I am drawn to nature and botanical art. I have always been fascinated by the trees and the flowers surrounding me. There is so much beauty around us and I believe it is a gift from our Heavenly Father. God created this world for us to enjoy and I am passionate about trying to recreate what I see around me.</p>
