            <h1>About My Art</h1>
            <p>The majority of my shared artworks consist of lifelike botanical watercolor paintings. My artistic journey started with colored pencils and pastels during my childhood, prompting me to revisit this medium. Recently, I crafted an original piece solely using colored pencils, choosing to depict the American Flag, a significant symbol of freedom, and titling it "In God We Trust." Diversifying my artistic range, I've also ventured into other subjects, such as this pumpkin, where I employed watercolor paints.</p>
            <p>Broadening the horizons of my artistic pursuits, I've explored a variety of subjects, including a pumpkin, using watercolor paints. The exploration of watercolor as my newfound medium is particularly captivating, given its versatility in styles, spanning from loose and expressive to meticulously realistic.</p>
