    <h2>Randi Putnam</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I have a Master's Degree in Educational Psychology and am currently working as a CTE Coordinator and Counselor for an 
        online school. I have recently felt strongly that it is time for a career change and am now excited to be working on Web Development 
        Certificate! I am nervous but excited to see where this takes me. </p>
    
    <p>I am married and have 3 beautiful daughters. I have been a member my whole life and know my life would look a lot differently without 
        the gospel in my life. I am excited to learn from you all. 
    </p>
